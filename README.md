# reinforcement-learning
Here you can find script with the home made environment and classes to play "hide and seek" and "pong" with several reinforcement learning algorithms

# Hide and seek/pong
game_actor_critic.py, game_ddqn.py, game_policy_gradient.py, game_policy_gradient_pro.py, are the main files to train a network to play at hide and seek or pong with different types algorithms.

game_actor_critic.py: use the actor critic algorithm

game_ddqn.py: use the deep reinforcement learning with doudle-Q learning algorithm

game_policy_gradient.py/game_policy_gradient_pro.py: use the policy gradient algorithm

# Pong
pong_battle.py is the main file to train 2 networks competing one against the other playing pong

# Library
AJ_lib_enviroment_lizard.py is the class of the environment of the hide and seek game

AJ_lib_enviroment_pong.py is the class of the environment of the pong game

AJ_lib_battle_enviroment.py is the class of the environment of the pong game with 2 network competing

AJ_lib_agent.py is the class with all the networks and training scripts
